That's it! It looks like you are ready to start your training! Should we begin?<br>
I know just the right place. You need to defeat monsters knowns as <font color="LEVEL">Honeybee, Wolf and Elder Fox. 15</font> monsters should be enough. It's pretty simple.<br>
Once you're done find Guard Silvan. Good luck!<br>
